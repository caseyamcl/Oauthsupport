OAuth Support
=============

A fork of Andy Smith's Oauth v1.0 library made compatible with Composer/Packagist

This library differs from other many Oauth client libraries, because it does not
contain any HTTP client code.  This means you can use any HTTP client you wish
(Guzzle, CURL, etc), and any method you wish for caching tokens.

This library merely prepares requests and provides support for server-side Oauth.
